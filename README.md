ViewSummary
===========

I could not find any good plugin that did what I wanted in Jenkins, so for fun and learning I wrote:

A summary dashboard that aggregates the information on other views in Jenkins. It has some configuration possibilities:

* include views either by selecting explicit or by regexp
* include total row
* include test cases
* changing colors

This is still a first draft implementation that works for my needs. If someone tries it please let me know if you have any constructive feedback.
