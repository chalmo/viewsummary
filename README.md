ViewSummary
===========

I could not find any good plugin that did what I wanted in Jenkins, so for fun and learning I wrote:

A summary dashboard that aggregates the information on other views in Jenkins. 

This is still a first draft implementation that works for my needs. If someone tries it please let me know if you have any constructive feedback.
